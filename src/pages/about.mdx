<h1 class="text-3xl"> About me</h1>

I'm Fiona (my cute name). I'm just a 15-year-old hobbyist developer.
I have an interest in compilers and programming language design. 

<h2 class="text-xl">Life</h2>
I'm a weeb, I like watching anime, reading manga, and listening to music.
I don't really like to play games and most of my time is spent reading information on my phone.

Yeah, Well, i'm from Indonesia. In real life I mostly use Sundanese, while online I use Bahasa Indonesia and English.

<h2 class="text-xl">Programming</h2>

I found quite a lot of information about many cool programming languages here.
Of the many programming languages, my favorites are: Go, Zig and Rust!

Reason? Because they fit with what I want: Simple, Easy, Fast~ Well, i use Rust because it's cool! Memory safety and modern.

<h2 class="text-xl">Author</h2>
I like to write, some of what I write is usually mystery stories, but I sometimes try to write technical things.

I myself am a lover of mystery novels, certainly not horror. Mystery novels like Sherlock Holmes.
